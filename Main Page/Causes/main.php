			<p>Industries are by far the worst polluters of the soil with all the chemicals they release into the environment be it in liquid or solid form. The latest study shows that toxic metals such as lead and cadmium are several times above the acceptable limits set by the Department of Environment (DoE). This is of particular concern as they can cause irreversible damage to flora and fauna.</p>
			<p>Samples taken from an oil palm plantation at Kampung Sri Cheeding found higher concentrations of lead (2,940-3,780mg/kg) and cadmium (13.8-16.7mg/kg) than usually found in soil in Malaysia. The DoE’s limits for these two heavy metals in residential soil is 400 mg/kg for lead and 71 mg/kg for cadmium.</p>

			<p>Garbage that cannot be recycled is disposed of carelessly and this is not only an eyesore but pollutes the land. Some of this waste can literally take thousands of years to decompose. Malaysia has become a favorite destination for plastic waste from developed countries after China banned the import of plastic waste in January 2018, with Putrajaya coming down hard on illegal recycling factories importing plastic waste. A previous investigation by Greenpeace found that some 2,880 tons of plastic were exported to Malaysia in the first nine months of 2019 from Italy alone, with nearly half of that going to illegal factories that had no capacity to deal with the plastic.</p>

			<p>Clearing of trees leaves soil exposed to the elements so they are easily carried away by soil erosion. This leaves land barren and incapable of supporting vegetation. Malaysia has the distinction of having the highest rate of forest loss of the main countries that are reducing their forest cover. After decades of unsustainable logging, which depleted timber stocks and undermined the viability of traditional forestry management, Malaysia’s forests are increasingly being converted for industrial oil palm plantations. The palm oil industry is a powerful political force in the country.</p>

  		<h3>Sewage</h3>
  		<img src="img/sewage.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px">
  		<p>With billions of people on the planet, disposing of sewage waste is a major problem. Sewage disposal affects people's immediate environments and leads to water-related illnesses such as diarrhea that kills 525,000 children under five each year. Yet the problem of sewage disposal does not end there. When you flush the toilet, the waste has to go somewhere and, even after it leaves the sewage treatment works, there is still waste to dispose of. In practice, sewage contains all kinds of other chemicals, from the pharmaceutical drugs people take to the paper, plastic, and other wastes they flush down their toilets. When people are sick with viruses, the sewage they produce carries those viruses into the environment. It is possible to catch illnesses such as hepatitis, typhoid, and cholera from rivers.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="Nutrients" class="tabcontent">
  		<h3>Nutrients</h3>
  		<img src="img/nutrients.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px">
  		<p>Chemical fertilizers used by farmers also add nutrients to the soil, which drain into rivers and seas and add to the fertilizing effect of the sewage. Together, sewage and fertilizers can cause a massive increase in the growth of algae or plankton that overwhelms huge areas of oceans, lakes, or rivers. This is known as a harmful algal bloom. It is harmful because it removes oxygen from the water that kills other forms of life, leading to what is known as a dead zone. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="WasteWater" class="tabcontent">
 		<h3>Waste Water</h3>
 		<img src="img/waste_water.png" style="width: 300px; height: 200px">
  		<p>Factories are point sources of water pollution, but quite a lot of water is polluted by ordinary people from nonpoint sources; this is how ordinary water becomes waste water in the first place. Virtually everyone pours chemicals of one sort or another down their drains or toilets. Even detergents used in washing machines and dishwashers eventually end up in our rivers and oceans. So do the pesticides we use on our gardens. A lot of toxic pollution also enters waste water from highway runoff.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="ChemicalWaste" class="tabcontent">
 		<h3>Chemical Waste</h3>
 		<img src="img/chemical_waste.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px">
  		<p>Another kind of toxic pollution comes from heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium, and mercury. Lead was once commonly used in gasoline (petrol), though its use is now restricted in some countries. Mercury and cadmium are still used in batteries (though some brands now use other metals instead). </p>
		</div>

		<div id="RadioactiveWaste" class="tabcontent">
 		<h3>Radioactive Waste</h3>
 		<img src="img/radioactive_waste.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px">
  		<p>Radioactive waste is any pollution that emits radiation beyond what is naturally released by the environment. It’s generated by uranium mining, nuclear power plants, and the production and testing of military weapons, as well as by universities and hospitals that use radioactive materials for research and medicine. Radioactive waste can persist in the environment for thousands of years, making disposal a major challenge </p>
		</div>

		<div id="Plastics" class="tabcontent">
 		<h3>Plastics</h3>
 		<img src="img/plastics.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px">
  		<p>Plastic is one of the most common materials, used for making virtually every kind of manufactured object from clothing to automobile parts; plastic is light and floats easily so it can travel enormous distances. Most plastics are not biodegradable (they do not break down naturally in the environment), which means that things like plastic bottle tops can survive in the marine environment for a long time. While plastics are not toxic in quite the same way as poisonous chemicals, they nevertheless present a major hazard to seabirds, fish, and other marine creatures. For example, plastic fishing lines and other debris can strangle or choke fish. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="AlienSpecies" class="tabcontent">
 		<h3>Alien Species</h3>
 		<img src="img/alien_species.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 300px">
  		<p>Alien species (sometimes known as invasive species) are animals or plants from one region that have been introduced into a different ecosystem where they do not belong. Outside their normal environment, they have no natural predators, so they rapidly run wild, crowding out the usual animals or plants that thrive there. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="TermalPollution" class="tabcontent">
 		<h3>Termal Pollution</h3>
 		<img src="img/thermal_pollution.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px">
  		<p>Heat or thermal pollution from factories and power plants also causes problems in rivers. By raising the temperature, it reduces the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water, thus also reducing the level of aquatic life that the river can support. </p>

      <p>Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas that is produced in the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels, such as gasoline, natural gas and oil and the largest anthropogenic source of CO in Malaysia is vehicle emissions. Car ownership in Malaysia is the third highest in the world at 93% and 54% of households have more than one car. Putting these statistics together it should come as no surprise that Malaysia suffers from periods of major CO pollution. When not affected by smoke haze, vehicular emissions account for around 70% of the total emissions in major urban areas such as Kuala Lumpur.</p>

  	<p>We people are surrounded by gadgets and use them extensively in our daily life. Gadgets like TV, mobile, mixer grinder, pressure cooker, vacuum cleaners, washing machine and dryer, cooler, air conditioners are minor contributors to the amount of noise that is produced. Still, it affects the quality of life of your neighborhood in a bad way.</p>
	<p>While this form of pollution may seem harmless, it, in fact, has far-reaching consequences. The adverse effects on the health of the environment are quite severe. Not only is the local wildlife affected by pollution, but humans also face a number of problems due to it.</p>

			<p>Light pollution, or excessive artificial light, is particularly prominent at night. It is mainly caused by misdirected, excessive, inefficient and unnecessary lighting systems. In urban areas where artificial light sources (e.g. street lights) are abundant, the phenomenon is common. When light shines upward, downward, or is reflected upward, it is dispersed by layers in the atmosphere, which results in a glow that reduces the darkness of night sky. </p>
			<p>Moreover, about 30% of outdoor lighting are poorly designed, thereby contributing to an excessive waste of energy as only 40% of the light is productive (lights up the areas intended). Ten per cent of the light is glare and the remaining 50% is wasted by sideways and upwards illumination.</p>
